# html-portfolio
This project is a basic static website built entirely using HTML. It serves as a straightforward example of a personal portfolio site, designed to demonstrate the foundational skills in HTML. The site includes several pages, such as an About Me section, a Portfolio section to display projects, and a Contact form.
